        What we know so far about [ HITORI ]?
    </p>
    <p>
        The creature was discovered after Dr. Ebizuka accidentally fell asleep in his lab and entered the world of emptiness. It is the only known creature living in that world, and it is believed that the world was created by the creature’s mind in order to protect itself. The creature is afraid of interacting and will fly to somewhere else if it feels danger. There is currently no sign of the creature to eat or reproduce.

        Guidelines for human interaction with this creature
    </p>
    <p>
        When observing the creature, stay away in a distance to avoid being seen by it. To explore how it escapes from interaction, try to get close at some point (you can do this by pressing the mouse) and see where it goes.
